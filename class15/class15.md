## Pathway Analysis

Here we are going to use the gage package for pathway analysis. Once we
have a list of enriched pathways, we’re going to use the pathview
package to draw pathway diagrams, shading the molecules in the pathway
by their degree of up/down-regulation.

KEGG pathways The gageData package has pre-compiled databases mapping
genes to KEGG pathways and GO terms for common organisms. kegg.sets.hs
is a named list of 229 elements. Each element is a character vector of
member gene Entrez IDs for a single KEGG pathway. (See also go.sets.hs).
The sigmet.idx.hs is an index of numbers of signaling and metabolic
pathways in kegg.set.gs. In other words, KEGG pathway include other
types of pathway definitions, like “Global Map” and “Human Diseases”,
which may be undesirable in a particular pathway analysis. Therefore,
kegg.sets.hs\[sigmet.idx.hs\] gives you the “cleaner” gene sets of
signaling and metabolic pathways only.

Side-Note: While there are many freely available tools to do pathway
analysis, and some like gage are truly fantastic, many of them are
poorly maintained or rarely updated. The DAVID tool that a lot of folks
use for simple gene set enrichment analysis was not updated at all
between Jan 2010 and Oct 2016.

The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where
the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

Note that we used the mapIDs() function above to obtain Entrez gene IDs
(stored in
res\(entrez) and we have the fold change results from DESeq2 analysis (stored in res\)log2FoldChange).

``` r
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

    ##        <NA>      148398       26155      339451       84069       84808 
    ##  0.17925708  0.42645712 -0.69272046  0.72975561  0.04057653  0.54281049

Now, let’s run the gage pathway analysis.

``` r
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

See help on the gage function with ?gage. Specifically, you might want
to try changing the value of same.dir. This value determines whether to
test for changes in a gene set toward a single direction (all genes up
or down regulated) or changes towards both directions simultaneously
(i.e. any genes in the pathway dysregulated). Here, we’re using the
default same.dir=TRUE, which will give us separate lists for pathways
that are upregulated versus pathways that are down-regulated.

Now lets look at the object returned from gage().

``` r
attributes(keggres)
```

    ## $names
    ## [1] "greater" "less"    "stats"

It is a list with three elements, “greater”, “less” and “stats”.

You can also see this in your Environmnet panel/tab window of RStudio or
use the R command str(keggres).

Like any list we can use the dollar syntax to access a named element,
e.g. head(keggres\(greater) and head(keggres\)less).

Lets look at the first few down (less) pathway results:

``` r
# Look at the first few down (less) pathways
head(keggres$less)
```

Each keggres\(less and keggres\)greater object is data matrix with gene
sets as rows sorted by p-value.

The top “less/down” pathways is “Cell cycle” with the KEGG pathway
identifier hsa04110.

Now, let’s try out the pathview() function from the pathview package to
make a pathway plot with our RNA-Seq expression results shown in color.
To begin with lets manually supply a pathway.id (namely the first part
of the “hsa04110 Cell cycle”) that we could see from the print out
above.

``` r
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110")
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:1 mapping between keys and columns

    ## Info: Working in directory C:/Users/chris/OneDrive/Desktop/BIMM143_F19/bimm143github/class15

    ## Info: Writing image file hsa04110.pathview.png

This downloads the pathway figure data from KEGG and adds our results to
it. Here is the default low resolution raster PNG output from the
pathview() call above:

Note how many of the genes in this pathway are perturbed (i.e. colored)
in our results.

You can play with the other input arguments to pathview() to change the
display in various ways including generating a PDF graph. For example:

``` r
# A different PDF based output of the same data
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa04110", kegg.native=FALSE)
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:1 mapping between keys and columns

    ## Info: Working in directory C:/Users/chris/OneDrive/Desktop/BIMM143_F19/bimm143github/class15

    ## Info: Writing image file hsa04110.pathview.pdf

Now, let’s process our results a bit more to automagicaly pull out the
top 5 upregulated pathways, then further process that just to get the
pathway IDs needed by the pathview() function. We’ll use these KEGG
pathway IDs for pathview plotting below.

``` r
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

    ## [1] "hsa04640" "hsa04630" "hsa00140" "hsa04142" "hsa04330"

Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to
draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.

``` r
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```

\#\#Section 3. Gene Ontology (GO) We can also do a similar procedure
with gene ontology. Similar to above, go.sets.hs has all GO terms.
go.subs.hs is a named list containing indexes for the BP, CC, and MF
ontologies. Let’s focus on BP (a.k.a Biological Process) here.

``` r
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)

# Focus on Biological Process subset of GO
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```
