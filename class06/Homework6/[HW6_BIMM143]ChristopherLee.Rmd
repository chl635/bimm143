```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The inputs to the function are the PDB IDs.
This function provides information about the protein from online by entering the PDB ID into the function named protein.
The output of the function is a plot of the residues for the protein
```{r}
protein <- function (x) {

library(bio3d)
s1 <- read.pdb(x) # kinase with drug

s1.chainA <- trim.pdb(s1, chain="A", elety="CA")

s1.b <- s1.chainA$atom$b

plotb3(s1.b, sse=s1.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")

}

protein("4AKE")
protein("1AKE")
protein("1E4Y")
```
